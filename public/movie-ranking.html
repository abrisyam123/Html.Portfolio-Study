<h1>The Best Movies According to Abrisyam</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>World War Z</h3>
<p>
  I love it because the zombie logic kind of make sense. They are not the usual
  slow walking movies which in my opinion would just be decimated by the modern
  army. Instead these are fast moving or as we would call it runners. They
  ignore their well being to chase you down and acts more like a virus looking
  for its host. This movie has alot of its clitche and i let it slide.

<h3>28 Days later</h3>
<p>
  This was one of my beloved zombie movie as i saw this growing up, cult
  classic. This movies actually instill the feeling of fear and dread which is
  hard to get when watching a zombie movie, well atleast for me. The soundtract
  for this movie is so peak its insane. The soundtract alone made some of the
  scene so intense. Worth a watch.

<h3>Shaun of the dead</h3>
<p>
  I love this movie so much as a kid and i still do now, an awesome combination
  of comedy and ultraviolence. This is another cult classic in my opinion, its
  so good.

<h3>I am legend</h3>
<p>
  This one is special because they are not necessarily zombies, watch the movie
  to figure it out. A very good twist to the movie, a lot of drama. It really
  makes you think deep once you understand what was really going on
